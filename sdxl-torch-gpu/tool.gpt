Summarize this prompt {prompt} text so that it captures the subject and style desired but stays under 80 characters.
summarize the negative prompt {negative_prompt} so that it is under 80 characters while keeping the intent

Then call the render tool with the prompt and negative prompts. If the number_of_images {number_of_images} wasn't set explicitly send a 1 otherwise
pass the value along to the render tool.

Return the json output as is to the caller.
